```
DAY=[DAY] bun dev [PART]
```

Example:

* Day 4, part 1 with test data: `DAY=4 bun dev 1`
* Day 4, part 2 with actual data: `DAY=4 bun prod 2`

Hint: Use `TESTFILE` to overwrite the name of the test file (defaults to "data.txt" for prod and "sample.txt" for dev)

**Note**: Day 1 Part 2 uses a different sample file: `TESTFILE=sample2.txt DAY=1 bun dev 2`
